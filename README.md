# Financial-Inclusion-Analysis-East_Africa

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.
The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. Your solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

## Conclusions


1.   Kenya has the lead when it comes to how many people have accounts while Rwanda has the highest number of people without bank accounts.
2.   Self employed people are more likely to have a bank account when compared to other employment classes. They are also the leading group without bank accounts.
3.   Slightly more males than females have access to bank accounts but on the other hand, there is a significantly larger number of females without bank accounts.
4.   Majority of non account holders come from Rural areas, making up 62.9% of the population.

## Recommendations

* Location: In order to increase Financial inclusion, there is a need to target people in Rural areas. This can be accomplished by either increasing the branches present in these areas or conducting mass education on the benefits and importance of having bank accounts.
* Household units: For children's sake, early reinforcement of the importance of having bank accounts could be essential in increasing the number of bank account holders in future. The other dependents like parents of heads of households can also be encouraged to have bank accounts for their pensions or passive income streams.
* Employment type: There is a high population of self employed people without bank accounts. Despite their independence, there is still need for financial literacy to be extended to them to prevent crippling their businesses.
* Gender: Women need to be encouraged not to be solely reliant on men and therefore emphasize the need of having their own savings with banks.
* Country: Rwanda needs mass education on financial literacy which can be as early as primary school level which was the most common level of education recorded. This can go a long way in encouraging more Rwandanese people in seeing banks as essential services.
